# Cohor Analysis  
## Objective:  
The goal of this project is to gain a solid understanding of how the modern data stack works together — from data ingestion and transformation to visualization — and how cohort analysis can reveal insights into repeat purchase behavior.  
- Main steps to achieve this:  
* Ingest e-commerce sales data from a GCP Cloud SQL database using Fivetran.
* Transform and model the data with Databricks, leveraging Delta Lake.
* Visualise cohort trends (e.g., time to second purchase) in a Databricks Dashboard.
